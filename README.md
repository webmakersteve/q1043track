This is a simple app for keeping track of radio plays. It keeps track of the time it fetched the new data and associates it with metadata.

There is no limit to what the data can be used for! Except that it's radio playlists. Current possibilities:

1. Exporting all of the X most popular songs into a playlist to be played in a music player, because thinking of what song to play next is the hardest part.
2. Seeing how long the commercials are on a radio station.
3. Having a structured way of building up a music metadata database of songs you enjoy.
4. Checking out the speed and awesomeness of Node.js's asynchronous methodology.

Thanks!
